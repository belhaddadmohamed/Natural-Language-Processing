76:5|But the righteous shall drink of a goblet mixed with camphor;
76:6|a fountain at which the worshipers of Allah drink and make it gush forth abundantly;
76:7|they who keep their vows and fear a Day whose evil is spread;
76:8|who give food, for the love of Him to the needy, the orphan, and the captive,
76:9|(saying): 'We feed you only desirous of the Face of Allah; we seek of you neither recompense nor thanks,
76:10|for we fear from our Lord a stern, frownful Day'
76:11|So Allah will save them from the evil of that Day and has secured for them radiance and joyfulness,
76:12|and recompense them for their patience with a Garden, and robes of silk.
76:13|Reclining there upon couches, they shall see neither the sun nor the moon.
76:14|Near them shall be its shades with its clusters hung gently down,
76:15|and passed around them shall be silver vessels, and crystal goblets,
76:16|goblets of silver that they have precisely measured.
76:17|And they shall be given to drink from a cup whose mixture is ginger,

76:26|and in the night prostrate to Him; and exalt Him for a long night.
76:27|Indeed, these love the hasty life, and are heedless and leave behind them a heavy Day.
76:28|We created them, and We strengthened their joints, but, when We will, We shall indeed exchange their likes.
76:29|This is indeed a Reminder, so that he who will, takes a path to his Lord.
76:30|Yet you will not unless Allah wills; surely, Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
76:31|He is Merciful to whom He will; but, for the harmdoers He has prepared for them a painful punishment.
