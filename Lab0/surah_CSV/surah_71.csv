verse|context
71:1|We sent Noah to his nation, saying: 'Give warning to your nation before a painful punishment overtakes them'
71:2|He said: 'My nation, I am a clear warner for you.
71:3|Worship Allah, fear Him, and obey me.
71:4|He will forgive you your sins and respite you till an appointed term. When the term of Allah arrives it cannot be deferred; if you but knew'
71:5|'My Lord' said he, 'night and day I have called my nation,
71:6|but my call has only increased them in running away.
71:7|Each time I called them so that You might forgive them, they thrust their fingers in their ears and wrapped themselves in their garments, and persisted becomingvery proud.
71:8|I called to them clearly,
71:9|and indeed, I spoke to them both publicly and in secret:
71:11|He will let loose the sky upon you in abundance
71:12|and give to you wealth and sons, and provide you with gardens and rivers.
71:13|What is the matter with you that you do not want the Greatness of Allah,
71:14|He has created you by stages!
71:15|Have you not seen how Allah created the seven heavens one above the other,
71:16|setting in them the moon as a light and the sun as a lantern?
71:17|Allah has caused you to grow out of the earth,
71:18|and to it He will return you. Then, He will bring you forth.
71:19|Allah has made the earth spread out for you
71:20|so that you walk in its spacious paths.'
71:21|Noah said: 'My Lord, they have rebelled against me and followed he whose wealth and offspring increase him only in loss,
71:22|they have devised a mighty plot,
71:23|and said: 'Do not renounce your gods, do not leave waddan or suwa'an or yaghutha, or ya'uqa, or nasra'
71:24|And they have led many astray. (Noah supplicated saying): 'Allah, do not increase the harmdoers except in error'
71:25|So because of their sins they were drowned and admitted into the Fire. They found none to help them other than Allah.
71:26|And Noah (supplicated) saying: 'My Lord, do not leave a single unbeliever upon the earth.
71:27|Surely, if You leave them they will mislead Your worshipers and father none but the immoral, and unbelievers.
71:28|Forgive me, My Lord, and my parents, and whosoever seeks refuge in my house as a believer, and the believers men and women alike, and do not increase the harmdoers except in ruin'
