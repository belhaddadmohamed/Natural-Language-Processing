37:1|By the aligners (angels) aligning.
37:2|and the drivers driving,
37:3|and those who recite the Remembrance
37:4|surely, your God is One,
37:5|the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between them; the Lord of the Easts.
37:6|We have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the planets,
37:7|a protection against every rebel satan;
37:8|so they cannot listen to the High Assembly, for they are pelted from every side.
37:9|They are rejected and theirs is an everlasting punishment;
37:10|except such as snatches a fragment, and he is pursued by a piercing flame.
37:11|So ask them, are they stronger in constitution, or those whom We have created. We have created them of sticky clay.
37:12|No, you marvel, while they scoff.
37:13|When they are reminded, they do not remember.
37:14|When they are shown a sign, they scoff at it
37:15|and say: 'This is nothing but clear sorcery'
37:16|What, when we are dead and become dust and bones, shall we be resurrected.
37:17|What, and our forefathers, the ancients'
37:18|Say: 'Yes, but worthless'
37:19|It will be but one Shout, then see, they are watching
37:20|and they will say: 'Woe for us. This is the Day of Recompense'
37:21|This is the Day of Decision which you belied.
37:22|Gather together the evildoers, their wives, and that they were worshipping,
37:23|other than Allah, and guide them to the Path of Hell!
37:24|And halt them so that they may be questioned.
37:25|'Why do you not help one another?
37:26|No, today they will resign themselves in submission,
37:27|and approach each other with questions,
37:28|saying: 'You used to come to us from the right hand'
37:29|But they reply: 'Rather, you were not believers.
37:30|We had no authority over you, but you were an insolent nation.
37:31|The statement of Our Lord is realized against us, and we are tasting it,
37:32|we perverted you, indeed, we were perverts'
37:33|Therefore, on that Day they will all share Our punishment.
37:34|As such We shall deal with the evildoers.
37:35|For when it was said to them: 'There is no god except Allah' they were always proud
37:36|and said: 'Are we to renounce our gods for the sake of a mad poet'
37:37|No, indeed, he has brought the truth, and confirmed the Messengers.
37:38|You shall certainly taste the painful punishment:
37:39|but you shall not be recompensed except for what you were doing.
37:40|But for the sincere worshipers of Allah,
37:41|there is waiting for them a known provision;
37:42|fruits. And they are receivers of generosity
37:43|in the Gardens of Delight,
37:44|sitting face to face upon couches,
37:45|a goblet from a spring shall be passed round to them
37:46|white, a delight to the drinkers,
37:47|there is neither sickness in it, nor intoxication.
37:48|And with them will be maidens (houris) who restrain their wide glances
37:49|as if they were hidden pearls.
37:50|They will go to one another asking each other questions.
37:51|One of them will say: 'I had a companion
37:54|And he will reply: 'Are you looking down (into Hell)'
37:55|Then, he will look and see him in the midst of Hell.
37:56|'By Allah' he will say, 'you almost destroyed me!
37:57|But for the Favor of Allah I should have surely been among those who were arraigned (with you in Hell).
37:58|What then, shall we not die
37:59|except our first death, and shall we not be punished'
37:60|Indeed, this is the mighty victory,
37:61|and for the like of this let the workers work.
37:62|Is this a better hospitality or the tree of AzZakkum!
37:63|We have made this (tree) a trial for the evildoers.
37:64|It is a tree that grows from the bottom of Hell;
37:65|its spathes are like the heads of satans
37:66|on it they shall feed, and with it they shall fill their bellies.
37:67|On top of it they shall have a brew of boiling water,
37:68|then their return is to Hell.
37:69|They found their fathers in error,
37:70|yet they run in their footsteps,
37:71|yet before them most of the ancients went astray,
37:72|though We had sent among them warners.
37:73|See then the end of those who were warned,
37:74|except the sincere worshipers of Allah.
37:75|Noah called to Us, and We are the Best to answer.
37:76|We saved him and his people from the great distress,
37:77|and We made his offspring the survivors.
37:78|And We let it remain upon him in the latter:
37:79|'Peace be upon Noah among all the worlds'
37:80|As such We recompense the gooddoers,
37:81|he was one of Our believing worshipers.
37:82|Afterwards We drowned the others.
37:83|Of his party was Abraham.
37:84|(Remember when) he came to his Lord with a pure heart;
37:85|and when he said to his father and to his nation: 'What do you worship?
37:86|It is falsehood that you desire gods other than Allah!
37:87|What do you think of the Lord of the Worlds'
37:88|He cast a glance at the stars
37:89|and said: 'Surely, I am sick (of what you worship)'
37:90|But they turned their backs and went away from him.
37:91|Then he turned to their gods, and said: 'What do you eat?
37:92|What is the matter with you, that you do not speak'
37:93|And he turned upon them striking them with the right hand.
37:94|Thereafter they (the people) came to him in haste.
37:95|He said: 'Do you worship what you, yourselves have carved
37:96|when it is Allah who created you and all that you do'
37:97|They replied: 'Build for him a building and cast him into the fire'
37:98|Their desire was to outwit him, but We made them to be the humiliated.
37:99|He said: 'I will go to my Lord; He will guide me.
37:100|My Lord, grant me a righteous (son)'
37:101|And We gave him the glad tidings of a very gentle son (Ishmael).
37:102|And when he reached the age of traveling with him, he said: 'My son, while I was sleeping I saw that I shall slaughter (sacrifice) you, tell me what is your opinion' He replied: 'Father, do as you are ordered (by Allah). Allah willing, you shall find me one of those who are steadfast'
37:103|And when they had both submitted, and his son had laid down prostrate upon his forehead,
37:104|We called to him, saying: 'O Abraham,
37:105|you have confirmed your vision' As such We recompense the gooddoers.
37:106|That was indeed a clear trial.
37:107|So, We ransomed him with a mighty sacrifice,
37:108|and We let it (the beautiful praise) remain upon him in the latter (generations),
37:109|'Peace be upon Abraham'
37:110|As such We recompense the gooddoers.
37:111|He was one of Our believing worshipers.
37:112|Then, We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac, a Prophet, one of the righteous,
37:113|and We blessed him and Isaac, and from their offspring are some gooddoers, and others who clearly wronged themselves.
37:114|We also favored Moses and Aaron
37:115|and We saved them with their nation from a great distress.
37:116|We helped them, and they became victorious,
37:117|and We gave them the Clear Book,
37:118|and guided them upon the Straight Path.
37:119|And We let it (the beautiful praise) remain upon on both of them in the latter (generations),
37:120|'Peace be upon Moses and Aaron'
37:121|As such We recompense the gooddoers.
37:122|They were among Our believing worshipers.
37:123|And Elias (El Yaseen) was among the Messengers.
37:124|He asked his people: 'Do you not fear (Allah)?
37:125|Do you call on Ba'lan (the idol Baal) and abandon the Best Creator,
37:126|Allah is your Lord and the Lord of your fathers, the ancients'
37:127|But they belied him, so they will be among the arraigned (in Hell),
37:128|except the sincere worshipers of Allah.
37:129|And We let it (the beautiful praise) remain upon him in the latter (generations),
37:130|'Peace be upon El Yaseen'
37:131|As such We recompense the gooddoers.
37:132|He was among Our believing worshipers.
37:133|Lot, too, was among the Messengers.
37:134|We saved him and all his kinsmen,
37:135|except an old woman who lingered,
37:136|and We destroyed the others.
37:137|You pass by them in the morning
37:138|and at night, will you not understand?
37:139|Jonah, too, was one of the Messengers.
37:140|He ran away to the laden ship,
37:141|and cast lots, and he was among the losers (of the lots that were cast).
37:142|So the whale swallowed him, for he was blameworthy,
37:143|and had he not been among those who exalt (Allah),
37:144|he would have lingered in its belly till the Day they are resurrected.
37:145|But We cast him, upon the shore, and he was ill,
37:146|and We caused a pumpkin tree to grow over him.
37:147|Then We sent him to a hundred thousand or more,
37:148|and they believed, and We gave them enjoyment for awhile.
37:149|Now, ask them, has your Lord daughters, and they sons?
37:150|Or, did We create the angels females while they were witnessing?
37:151|Then is it of their lying that they say:
37:152|'Allah has begotten' They are truly liars.
37:153|Has He chosen daughters above sons?
37:154|What is the matter with you? How do you judge?
37:155|What, will you not remember?
37:156|Or, do you have a clear authority?
37:157|Bring your Book, if what you say is true!
37:158|They assert kinship between Him and the angels. But the angels know that they (the liars) will be arraigned (in Hell).
37:159|Exaltations to Allah above what they describe,
37:160|except for the sincere worshipers of Allah.
37:161|But as for you, and that you worship,
37:162|you shall tempt none against Him
37:163|except for he who shall roast in Hell.
37:164|(Gabriel said to the Prophet): 'Each of us has a known place.
37:165|We are surely those who are arranged in ranks.
37:166|And we are they who exalt (Allah)'
37:167|What, would they then say:
37:168|'If only we had a reminder from the ancients,
37:169|we would have been sincere worshipers of Allah'
37:170|But they disbelieve in it (the Koran), but soon they shall know!
37:171|Our Word had already preceded Our worshipers, the Messengers,
37:172|that they shall receive Our help
37:173|and Our armies shall be the victors.
37:174|So turn (away) from them for a while.
37:175|See them and soon they shall see.
37:176|What, do they seek to hasten Our punishment?
37:177|When it descends upon their courtyards, evil will be the morning of those forewarned.
37:178|So turn (away) from them for a while,
37:179|and see, soon they shall see!
37:180|Exaltations be to your Lord, the Lord of Might, above that they describe!
37:181|Peace be on the Messengers.
37:182|And praise belongs to Allah, Lord of the Worlds.
