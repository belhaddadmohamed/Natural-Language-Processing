92:1|By the night, when it envelops,
92:2|and by the day when it unveils.
92:3|And by Who created the male and female,
92:4|your striving is indeed to different ends!
92:5|For him that gives and fears (Allah)
92:6|and believes in the finest,
92:7|We shall surely ease him to the Path of Easing;
92:8|but for him that is a miser, and sufficed,
92:9|and he belied the finest
92:10|We shall surely ease for him the Path of Hardship (the Fire).
92:11|When he falls (into Hell), his wealth will not help him.
92:12|Indeed, Guidance is Ours,
92:13|and to Us belong the Last and the First.
92:14|I have now warned you of the Blazing Fire,
92:15|in which none shall be roasted except the most wretched sinner,
92:16|who belied and turned away,
92:17|and from which the cautious shall be distanced.
92:18|He who gives his wealth to be purified,
92:19|and confers no favor upon anyone for recompense
92:20|seeking only the Face of his Lord, the Most High,
92:21|surely, he shall be satisfied.
