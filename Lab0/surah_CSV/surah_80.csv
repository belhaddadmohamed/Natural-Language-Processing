80:1|He frowned and turned away
80:2|when the blind came to him.
80:3|And what could let you know? Perhaps he (comes to hear you) to be purified.
80:4|(He might) remember, and the Reminder might profit him.
80:5|As for he who is sufficed
80:6|you attended to him,
80:7|although it is not for you to be concerned if he remained unpurified.
80:8|And to him who came to you eagerly
80:9|and fearfully,
80:10|of him you were unmindful.
80:11|No indeed, this is a Reminder;
80:12|and whosoever wills, shall remember it.
80:13|upon highly honored pages,
80:14|exalted, purified,
80:15|by the hands of scribes
80:16|noble and pious.
80:17|Perish the human! How unthankful he is!
80:18|From what did He create him?
80:19|From a (sperm) drop He created him and then determined him,
80:20|then eased his path for him,
80:21|then causes him to die and buries him,
80:22|then, He will raise him when He wills.
80:23|Indeed, he has not fulfilled that which He has ordered him.
80:24|Let the human reflect on the food he eats,
80:25|how We pour down rain in abundance,
80:26|and split the earth, splitting,
80:27|how We made the grain to grow,
80:28|grapes, and fresh fodder,
80:29|and the olive, and the palm,
80:30|the densely tree'd gardens,
80:31|and fruit and pastures,
80:32|for you and for your herds to delight in.
80:33|But, when the Blast comes,
80:34|on that Day each person will flee from his brother,
80:35|his mother and his father,
80:36|his wife and his children.
80:37|Everyone on that Day will have affairs to keep him occupied.
80:38|Some faces will shine,
80:39|laughing and joyful,
80:40|whereas some faces will be covered with dust
80:41|and veiled with darkness.
80:42|Those, they are the unbelievers, the immoral.
