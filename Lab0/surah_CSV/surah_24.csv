24:1|This is a chapter which We have sent down and appointed; and in it We have sent down clear verses in order that you will remember.
24:2|You shall lash the fornicatress and the fornicator each with a hundred lashes. In the religion of Allah, let no tenderness for them seize you if you believe in Allah and the Last Day; and let their punishment be witnessed by a party of believers.
24:3|The fornicator shall marry none but a fornicatress or an idolatress; and the fornicatress none shall marry her but a fornicator or an idolater; that is forbidden to the believers.
24:4|Those who accuse chaste women, and cannot produce four witnesses, you shall lash them with eighty lashes. And never accept their testimony, for they are evildoers,
24:5|except those among them that afterwards repent and mend their ways. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
24:6|And those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses except themselves, let them testify by swearing by Allah four times that he is of the truthful,
24:7|and the fifth time, that the curse of Allah shall be upon him, if he should be of the liars.
24:8|But the punishment will be averted from her if she swears four times that he is of the liars,
24:9|and on the fifth time the Wrath of Allah shall be upon her if he is of the truthful.
24:10|If it were not for the bounty of Allah to you and His Mercy, and that Allah turns, and is the Wise,
24:11|those who came with the slander were a number of you. Do not regard it evil for you, rather it is good for you. Every person of them shall have the sin that he has earned charged to him. As for he who took upon himself the greater part there is a mightier punishment.
24:12|Had you heard it, and the believing men and women, thought good thoughts about one another said: 'This is a clear falsehood'
24:13|Why, did they not bring four witnesses against it? But since they did not bring the witnesses, before Allah they are the liars.
24:14|But for the bounty of Allah and His Mercy towards you in this life and in the Everlasting Life you would have been sternly punished for that which you were involved.
24:15|You carried with your tongues and uttered with your mouths what you did not know. You have thought it a trifle, but before Allah it was a mighty thing.
24:16|When you heard it, why did you not say: 'It is not right for us to speak of this. Exaltations to You! This is a mighty slander'
24:17|Allah exhorts you never again to repeat the like, if you are believers.
24:18|Allah makes plain to you His verses, and Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
24:19|Those who love that indecency should be broadcast about those who believe theirs is a painful punishment in this world and in the Everlasting Life. Allah knows, and you do not know.
24:20|If it was not for the bounty of Allah to you and His Mercy, and Allah is the Gentle, the Most Merciful.
24:21|Believers, do not follow in the steps of satan, for those who follow the steps of satan, he bids to indecency and dishonor. But for the bounty of Allah to you, and His Mercy no one of you would ever have been purified; but Allah purifies whom He will; Allah is the Hearer, the Knower.
24:22|Do not let those of you who possess bounty and plenty swear not to give kinsmen, and the poor, and those who emigrate in the way of Allah. Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not yearn that Allah forgives you? And Allah is the Forgiver, the Most Merciful.
24:23|Surely, those who defame chaste, unsuspecting, believing women, shall be cursed in this world and in the Everlasting Life, and for them there is a mightypunishment.
24:24|On the Day when their tongues, hands and feet shall testify against them concerning what they were doing.
24:25|Upon that Day Allah will pay them their due in full, and they will know that Allah is the clear truth.
24:26|Evil women for evil men, and evil men for evil women; good women for good men, and good men for good women these are clear of what has been said; for them is forgiveness, and a generous provision.
24:27|Believers, do not enter houses other than your houses until you first ask permission and greet with peace the people thereof; that is better for you in order that you remember.
24:28|And if you do not find anyone there, do not enter it until permission is given to you. And if you are told 'Return', so return, that is purer for you; and Allah knows the things you do.
24:29|There is no fault in you that you enter uninhabited houses wherein there is benefit for you. Allah knows what you reveal and what you hide.
24:30|Say to the believers they should lower their gaze and guard their private parts that is purer for them. Allah is Aware of the things they do.
24:31|And say to the believing women, that they lower their gaze cast down their eyes and guard their chastity, and do not reveal their adornment except that which is outward (face and hands); and let them draw their veils over their neck, and not reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands' fathers, or their sons, or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or what their right hands own, or such male attendants having no sexual desire, or children who have not yet attained knowledge of women's private parts; nor let them stamp their feet, so that their hidden ornament is known. And, O believers turn to Allah all together, in order that you prosper.
24:32|Marry those among you who are spouseless and the virtuous among your male and female slaves (thereby freeing them), if they are poor, Allah will enrichthem of His bounty; Allah is Embracing, Knowing.
24:33|Let those who do not find the means to marry be abstinent until Allah enriches them of His bounty. Those your right hand owns who seek their freedom, make a contract with them accordingly if you know some good in them, and give them from the wealth of Allah that He has given you. Do not force your slavegirls into prostitution in order to seek worldly gain for they wish to preserve their chastity. Whosoever compels them, surely Allah, after their being compelled, is the Forgiver (to the girls), the Most Merciful.
24:34|Now We have sent down to you clarifying verses, and an example of those who passed away before you and admonition to the cautious.
24:35|Allah is the Lighter of the heavens and the earth. The example of His Light is like a tube, in which there is a wick. The wick is in a lamp and the lamp is as a glittering planet kindled from a Blessed Tree, an olive that is neither of the East nor of the West. Its oil would almost shine forth though no fire touched it. Light upon light; Allah guides to His Light whom He will. Allah strikes parables for people. Allah has knowledge of all things.
24:36|In houses which Allah has allowed to be raised up, and His Name to be remembered therein. In the morning and evening
24:37|are men who exalt Him there, whom neither trade nor sale can divert from the remembrance of Allah, and establish the prayers, and pay the obligatorycharity; fearing a Day when hearts and eyes shall be turned about,
24:38|that Allah will recompense them for the finest deeds they did and increase them from His bounty. Allah provides without measure to whom He will.
24:39|As for the unbelievers, their works are like a mirage in the wilderness. The thirsty person thinks it is water, but when he comes near he finds that it is nothing. He finds Allah there, who pays him his account in full. Allah is Swift in reckoning.
24:40|Or, they are like darkness upon a deep sea covered with a wave above which is another wave, above which are clouds, darkness piled one upon the other; when he stretches out his hand he can scarcely see it. Indeed, to whomsoever Allah assigns no light, he shall have no light.
24:41|Have you not seen how Allah is exalted by those in the heavens and earth, and the birds with outspread wings? He knows its prayers and its exaltations and Allah has knowledge of the things they do.
24:42|To Allah belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. To Him is the arrival.
24:43|Have you not seen how Allah drives the clouds, then gathers them and converts them into a mass, then you see rain coming from the midst of them? And He sends down out of heaven mountains in which there is hail, pelting with it whom He will, and turning it away from whom He will. The flash of its lightning almost snatches away the sight.
24:44|Allah turns about the night and the day (to succeed one another); surely, in this there is a lesson for those who have eyes.
24:45|Allah created everything that walks from water. Some creep upon their bellies, others walk on two feet, and others walk on four. Allah creates whatever He will. Allah is Powerful over everything.
24:46|We have sent down clarifying verses. Allah guides whom He will to a Straight Path.
24:47|They say: 'We believe in Allah and the Messenger and obey' But a party of them turn away after this. Those are not believers.
24:48|And when they are called to Allah and His Messenger so that he judges between them, a party of them swerve away.
24:49|If the right is theirs, they would have hastened to him obediently.
24:50|Is there a sickness in their hearts, or, are they in doubt? Do they fear that Allah and His Messenger will be unjust? No, but those they are the harmdoers.
24:51|But when the believers are called to Allah and His Messenger, in order that he judges between them, their reply is: 'We hear and obey' Such are theprosperous.
24:52|Those who obey Allah and His Messenger, and fear Allah, and have awe of Him, shall be the winners.
24:53|They swear by Allah in the most earnest oaths, that if you order them, they would go forth. Say: 'Do not swear, known obedience (is better). Allah is Aware of the things you do'
24:54|Say: 'Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. If you turn away, upon him only rests what is laid upon him, and upon you rests what is laid on you. If you obey him, you shall be guided. It is only for the Messenger to deliver a clear message'
24:55|Allah has promised those of you who believe and do good works that He will indeed make them successors in the land as He made those who were before them successors, and that He will indeed establish their religion for them; that which He has approved for them, and will exchange safety for them after their fear. They worship Me and associate nothing with Me. After that, those who disbelieve are the impious.
24:56|Establish the prayers, pay the charity, and obey the Messenger, in order to have mercy.
24:57|Never think that the unbelievers will be able to frustrate (Us) in the earth. Their refuge is the Fire, an evil arrival.
24:58|Believers, let those your right hand owns and those who have not come of age ask permission of you three times before the dawn prayer, when you put aside your garments, in the heat of noon, and after the night prayer. These are the three occasions of privacy. There is no fault in you or them, apart from these, that they go about you, you are of each other. As such Allah makes plain to you His verses, Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
24:59|And when children reach the age of puberty, let them ask permission as those before them asked permission. As such Allah makes clear to you His verses. Allah is the Knower, the Wise.
24:60|(As for) women that are past childbearing who have no hope of marriage there is no fault in them that they discard their cloaks provided they do not reveal their adornments, but it is better if they abstain. Allah is the Hearer, the Knower.
24:61|It shall be no fault for the blind, the lame, the sick and yourselves to eat from your houses. Nor the houses of your fathers', your mothers', your brothers', your sisters', your paternal uncles, your paternal aunts, your maternal uncles, your maternal aunts or in houses the keys of which you own, or in those of your friend, there is no fault in you that you all eat together, or separately. When you enter houses, greet (with peace) one another with a salutation from Allah, blessed and good. As such Allah makes clear to you His verses so that you understand.
24:62|The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and who, when gathered with him upon a common matter do not depart till they have asked his permission. Surely, those who ask your permission are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. When they ask your permission for some of their affairs, grant it to whomever you please and ask Allah for forgiveness for them; Allah is the Forgiver, the Merciful.
24:63|Do not make the calling of the Messenger among yourselves like your calling to one another. Allah knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously, so let those who disobey His command beware, lest they are struck by sedition, or, they are stricken with a painful punishment.
24:64|To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He has Knowledge of what state you are upon. On the Day when they shall be returned to Him, He will tell them all what they have done. And Allah has knowledge of everything.
