82:1|When the sky is split,
82:2|when the planets are scattered,
82:3|when the oceans are gushed forth,
82:4|when the graves are overturned,
82:5|the soul shall know what it has done, the former and the latter.
82:6|O human! What has deceived you concerning your Generous Lord
82:7|who created you, formed you and proportioned you?
82:8|In whatever shape He will He could surely have fashioned you.
82:9|Rather, you belied the Recompense.
82:10|Yet over you there are watchers,
82:11|noble scribes
82:12|who know of all that you do.
82:13|Indeed, the righteous shall (live) in bliss.
82:14|But the wicked, indeed they shall be in the Fiery Furnace,
82:15|roasting in it on the Day of Recompense
82:16|and from it they shall never be absent.
82:17|What could let you know what the Day of Recompense is!
82:18|Again, what could let you know what the Day of Recompense is!
82:19|It is the Day when no soul can do a thing for another soul. That Day, the command belongs to Allah.
