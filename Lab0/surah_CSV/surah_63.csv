63:1|When the hypocrites come to you they say: 'We bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allah' Allah knows that you (Prophet Muhammad) are indeedHis Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are truly liars!
63:2|They have taken their oaths as a cover and barred others from the Path of Allah. Evil is what they have done.
63:3|That is because they believed, then disbelieved, because of this a seal has been set upon their hearts so they are unable to understand.
63:4|When you see them their bodies please you, but when they speak and you listen to their sayings, they are like proppedup timber. Every shout (they hear) they take it to be against them. They are the enemy be wary of them. Allah kills them! How perverse they are!
63:5|When it is said to them: 'Come, the Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you' they turn their heads in pride and you see them go away.
63:6|It is equal for them whether you ask for their forgiveness or you do not ask for their forgiveness, Allah will not forgive them. Allah does not guide the evildoers.
63:7|It is they that say: 'Spend nothing on those who follow the Messenger of Allah until they disperse' Yet to Allah belong the treasuries of heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand.
63:8|They say: 'If we return to the City, the strong will expel the humiliated' But the might belongs to Allah, and His Messenger and the believers, but thehypocrites do not know.
63:9|Believers, do not let either your possessions or your children divert you from the Remembrance of Allah. Those who do that shall be the losers.
63:10|So spend of that with which We have provided you before death comes upon any of you and he then says: 'O my Lord, if only You would defer me to anear term, so that I could give in charity and be among the good doers'
63:11|But Allah will never defer any soul when its term comes. Allah is Aware of what you do.
