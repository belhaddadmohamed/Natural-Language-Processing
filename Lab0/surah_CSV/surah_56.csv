56:1|When the Event (the resurrection) comes
56:2|there is no denying its coming
56:3|(it will) abase (some) and exalt (others).
56:4|When the earth is shaken
56:5|and the mountains fragmented
56:6|becoming scattered dust,
56:7|you shall be divided into three parties,
56:8|Companions of the Right, what are the Companions of the Right?
56:9|Companions of the Left, what are the Companions of the Left?
56:10|And the Outstrippers, the Outstrippers
56:11|those are they brought near (to their Lord)
56:12|in the Gardens of Delight,
56:13|a host of the ancients
56:14|but only a few from the later generations.
56:15|on lavish couches
56:16|they shall recline, facing each other,
56:17|(and there) shall wait on them immortal youths
56:18|with goblets and ewers, and a cup from a spring
56:19|that will neither make the head throb, nor intoxicate,
56:20|with fruits of their own choice
56:21|and any flesh of fowl that they desire.
56:22|And wideeyed houris
56:23|like hidden pearls,
56:24|a recompense for all that they did.
56:25|There they shall hear no idle talk, no cause of sin,
56:26|but only the saying: 'Peace, Peace'
56:27|The Companions of the Right
56:28|(will be) among thornless Lote trees.
56:29|Bananatrees, piled
56:30|and continuous shade,
56:31|and flowing water
56:32|and an abundance of fruits,
56:33|unfailing and not forbidden.
56:34|And couches raised up.
56:35|Indeed We formed them (the houris and all believing women),
56:36|and made them virgins,
56:37|chaste, loving companions of the same age
56:38|for the Companions of the Right
56:39|a multitude of the ancients,
56:40|and a multitude of the later people.
56:41|As for the Companions of the Left
56:42|(they shall live) amid burning winds and boiling water,
56:43|in the shadow of a smoking blaze,
56:44|neither cool nor good.
56:45|Before they lived at ease,
56:46|and persisted in the great sin
56:47|and constantly said: 'What, when we are dead and become dust and bones, shall we then be restored to life?
56:48|What, and our fathers, the ancients'
56:49|Say: 'Those of ancient times and those of later times
56:50|shall be gathered together to the appointed time on a known Day'
56:51|Then you went astray, you that belied,
56:52|you shall eat (the fruit) of the Tree of Zakkum.
56:53|You shall fill your bellies with it,
56:54|and drink boiling water on top of that,
56:55|and you will drink as the lapping of thirsty camels.
56:56|Such shall be your hospitality on the Day of Recompense.
56:57|We created you, why will you not believe!
56:58|Have you thought about what (sperm) you ejaculate?
56:59|Did you create it, or are We the Creator?
56:60|It was We who decreed death among you. We will not be surpassed
56:61|that We will change you and cause you to grow again in a way you do not know.
56:62|You have surely known of the first creation. Why then, will you not remember!
56:63|Ponder upon the soil you till,
56:64|is it you that sow it, or are We the Sower?
56:65|If We will, We would make it broken stubble and you would remain wondering,
56:66|(Saying:) 'We are laden with debts!
56:67|Rather, we have been prevented'
56:68|Have you thought about the water you drink?
56:69|Is it you that send it down from the clouds or We?
56:70|If We will, We would make it bitter, why then do you not give thanks?
56:71|Have you thought about the fire you kindle?
56:72|Is it you that originated its tree, or are We the Originator?
56:73|We have made it a reminder, and a blessing to the traveler.
56:74|Then, exalt the Name of your Lord, the Great.
56:75|I swear by the fallings of the stars
56:76|and that is a mighty oath, if you but knew
56:77|it is indeed a Glorious Koran,
56:78|in a Book protected (from tampering)
56:79|which none shall touch except the purified;
56:80|a sending down from the Lord of all the Worlds.
56:81|What, do you hold this discourse in disdain,
56:82|do you make it your provision to belie it?
56:83|Why, then, when the soul leaps up to the throat of the dying
56:84|and you are watching at that time
56:85|We are nearer to him than you, but you do not see
56:86|why then, if you are not revived,
56:87|do you not restore his soul, if you are truthful?
56:88|If he is among the near
56:89|there shall be calmness and ease, a Garden of Delight.
56:90|If he is a Companion of the Right
56:91|(he will be greeted with): 'Peace be upon you, Companion of the Right'
56:92|But, if he is of those who belied, and went astray,
56:93|there shall be a hospitality of boiling water,
56:94|and a roasting in Hell.
56:95|Indeed, this is the certain truth.
56:96|So exalt the Name of your Lord, the Great.
