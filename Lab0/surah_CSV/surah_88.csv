verse|context
88:1|Have you received the news of the Enveloper?
88:2|On that Day faces shall be humbled,
88:3|laboring, wornout,
88:4|roasting at a scorching Fire
88:5|that is fueled from a tremendously hot fountain,
88:6|no food for them except thorny plants
88:7|which neither sustains, nor satisfy hunger.
88:8|(Whereas other) faces on that Day will be joyful,
88:9|well pleased with their striving,
88:10|in a Garden on high,
88:11|where they will hear no idle talk.
88:12|A gushing fountain shall be there
88:13|and raised couches,
88:14|and prepared goblets,
88:15|and arranged cushions
88:16|and outspread carpets.
88:17|What, do they not reflect upon how the camel was created?
88:18|And how the heaven was raised up,
88:19|and how the mountains were firmly fixed?
88:20|And how the earth was outstretched?
88:21|Therefore remind, you are only a Reminder.
88:22|You are not charged to oversee them.
88:23|As for those who turn their back and disbelieve,
88:24|Allah will punish them with the greatest punishment.
88:25|Indeed, to Us they shall return,
88:26|then upon Us shall rest their reckoning.
