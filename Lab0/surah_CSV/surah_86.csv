86:1|By the sky, and by the nightly comer!
86:2|What could let you know what the nightly comer is!
86:3|(It is) the piercing star.
86:4|For every soul there is a watcher.
86:5|Let the human reflect of what he is created.
86:6|He was created from ejaculated water
86:7|that issues from between the loins and the ribs.
86:8|Surely, He is Able to bring him back,
86:9|on the Day when consciences are examined,
86:10|when he will be helpless, with no supporter.
86:11|By the sky with its returning rain,
86:12|and by the earth bursting with vegetation;
86:13|this is indeed a Decisive Word,
86:14|it is not a jest.
86:15|They are cunningly devising,
86:16|and I am cunningly devising.
86:17|Therefore respite the unbelievers, and delay them for a while.
