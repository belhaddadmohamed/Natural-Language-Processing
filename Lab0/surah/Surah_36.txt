36:1 | YaSeen.
36:2 | By the Wise Koran,
36:3 | you (Prophet Muhammad) are truly among the Messengers sent
36:4 | upon a Straight Path.
36:5 | The sending down of the Mighty, the Most Merciful
36:6 | so that you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned, and so were heedless.
36:7 | The Phrase has become obligatory upon most of them, yet they do not believe.
36:8 | We have bound their necks with fetters up to their chin, so that their heads are raised and cannot be lowered.
36:9 | We have set a barrier before them and a barrier behind them, and, We have covered them so that they do not see.
36:10 | It is the same whether you have warned them or you have not warned them, they do not believe.
36:11 | You only warn he who follows the Remembrance and fears the Merciful in the Unseen. Give to him glad tidings of forgiveness and a generous wage.
36:12 | Surely, it is We who revive the dead and write down what they have forwarded and what they have left behind; We have counted everything in a Clear Book.
36:13 | Give to them a parable; to the people of the village there came Messengers,
36:14 | We sent to them two, but they belied them so We reinforced them with a third. They said: 'We have surely been sent as Messengers to you'
36:15 | But they said: 'You are only humans like ourselves. The Merciful has not sent down anything, your speech is but lies'
36:16 | They said: 'Our Lord knows that we are Messengers to you.
36:17 | And it is only for us to deliver a Clear Message'
36:18 | They answered: 'We predict evil of you. If you do not desist, we will stone you and a painful punishment from us will befall you'
36:19 | They said: 'Your prediction is with you, if you are reminded. Surely, you are but a wayward nation'
36:20 | Then, a man came running from the furthest part of the village 'My nation' he said, 'follow the Messengers,
36:21 | follow those who ask no wage of you and are rightly guided.
36:22 | Why should I not worship Him who has originated me and to whom you shall all be returned?
36:23 | What, shall I take, other than Him, gods whose intercession, if the Merciful desires to afflict me, cannot help me at all, and they will never save me?
36:24 | Surely, I should then be in clear error.
36:25 | I believe in your Lord, so hear me'
36:26 | It was said (to him): 'Enter Paradise' and he said: 'Would that my people knew
36:27 | that my Lord has forgiven me, and caused me to be amongst the receivers of generosity'
36:28 | And We did not send down to his nation after him any army from heaven, neither would We send any down.
36:29 | It was only one Shout and they were silent, still.
36:30 | Woe, for those (unbelieving) worshipers! They mocked every Messenger that came to them.
36:31 | Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them? They shall never return to them,
36:32 | all shall be arraigned before Us.
36:33 | The dead land is a sign for them. We revive it, and from it produce grain from which they eat.
36:34 | And there We made gardens of palms and vines, and in it We caused fountains to gush forth,
36:35 | so that they might eat of its fruit and the labor of their hands. Will they not give thanks?
36:36 | Exaltations to Him who created pairs of all the things the earth produces and of themselves, and that of which they have no knowledge.
36:37 | A sign for them is the night. From it We withdraw the day and they are in darkness.
36:38 | The sun runs to its fixed restingplace; that is the decree of the Almighty, the Knower.
36:39 | And the moon, We have determined it in phases till it returns like an old palmbranch.
36:40 | The sun shall not outstrip the moon, nor shall the night outstrip the day. Each is floating in an orbit.
36:41 | And a sign for them is that We carried their offspring in the laden Ark (of Noah).
36:42 | And We have created for them the like of it in which they board.
36:43 | We drown them if We will, then they have none to cry to, nor can they be saved,
36:44 | except through Our Mercy and as enjoyment for awhile.
36:45 | When it is said to them: 'Have fear of that which is before you and behind you in order that you find mercy'
36:46 | Yet there never comes to them any sign of their Lord's signs, but they turn away from it.
36:47 | And when it is said to them: 'Spend of that which Allah has given you' the unbelievers say to the believers: 'Are we to feed those whom Allah can feed if He chooses? Surely, you are only in clear error'
36:48 | They also say: 'When will this promise be, if what you say is true'
36:49 | They await but one Shout, which will seize them while they dispute.
36:50 | Then they will be unable to make a will, nor shall they return to their kinsmen.
36:51 | And the Horn is blown, and, from the graves they rush forth to their Lord.
36:52 | 'Woe for us' they will say. 'Who has roused us from our sleepingplace? This is what the Merciful promised; the Messengers have spoken the truth'
36:53 | And it is but one Shout and they are all arraigned before Us.
36:54 | Today, no soul shall be wronged a thing. You shall not be recompensed except according to your deeds.
36:55 | Indeed, the companions of the Garden are this Day busy in their rejoicing.
36:56 | Together with their spouses, they shall recline on couches in the shade.
36:57 | They shall have fruits and all that they call for.
36:58 | Peace, a saying from the Most Merciful Lord.
36:59 | (And He will say): 'Distance yourselves, O sinners, this Day.
36:60 | Children of Adam, did I not make a covenant with you, that you should not worship satan he is surely a clear enemy to you
36:61 | and that you worship Me? Surely, that is the Straight Path.
36:62 | Yet he has led many a host of you astray, did you not understand?
36:63 | This, then is Gehenna (Hell), that which you were promised.
36:64 | Roast well therein this Day for you were unbelievers'
36:65 | This Day We set a seal on their mouths and their hands speak to Us, and their feet will testify to their earnings.
36:66 | Had it been Our will We would have obliterated their sight so that they raced to the Path. But, how would they see?
36:67 | Had it been Our will We would have transmuted them (into monkeys, pigs and stones) where they were, so that they could neither go forward nor yet return.
36:68 | To whoever We give a long life We make him stoop. Do they not understand?
36:69 | We have not taught him (Prophet Muhammad) poetry, nor does it become him. This is only a Remembrance and a Clear Holy Reading (Koran)
36:70 | that he may warn the living, and so that Judgement may be passed against the unbelievers.
36:71 | Have they not seen how We have created for them the cattle they master with Our Hands?
36:72 | We have subdued these to them, and some of them they ride and some of them they eat;
36:73 | they also have other uses in them and drinks. What, will they not give thanks!
36:74 | And yet they have taken gods, other than Allah, so that they might helped!
36:75 | They cannot help them, for them (the socalled) army are brought (with them to Hell).
36:76 | So do not let their sayings grieve you. Surely, We have knowledge of what they hide and all that they reveal.
36:77 | Has the human not seen how We created him from a drop (of sperm)? Yet he is a clear opponent.
36:78 | And he has struck for Us a parable, and forgotten his own creation. He asks: 'Who will quicken the bones after they have decayed'
36:79 | Say: 'He will quicken them who originated them the first time; He has knowledge of every creation;
36:80 | who has made fire for you from the green tree with which you kindle'
36:81 | Is He who created the heavens and the earth unable to create their like? Yes, indeed, He is the Creator, the Knower.
36:82 | When He wills a thing, His command is to say to it 'Be', and it is!
36:83 | Exaltations to Him in whose Hand is the Kingdom of all things, and to Him you will be returned.
