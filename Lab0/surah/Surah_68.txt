68:1 | Noon. By the Pen and that (the angels) write,
68:2 | you are not, because of the favor of your Lord, mad.
68:3 | Indeed, there is an unfailing wage for you.
68:4 | Surely, you (Prophet Muhammad) are of a great morality.
68:5 | You shall see and they will see
68:6 | which of you is the demented.
68:7 | Indeed, your Lord knows very well those who strayed from His Path, and those who are guided.
68:8 | Therefore, do not obey those who belie,
68:9 | they wish you would compromise, then, they would compromise.
68:10 | And do not obey every mean swearer,
68:11 | the backbiter who goes about slandering,
68:12 | those who hinder good, the guilty aggressor,
68:13 | the crude of low character
68:14 | because he has wealth and sons.
68:15 | When Our verses are recited to him, he says: 'They are but fairytales of the ancients'
68:16 | We shall mark him upon his nose!
68:17 | We have tried them as We tried the owners of the garden who had sworn that in the morning they would reap it,
68:18 | without adding to their swearing, (Allah willing, InshaAllah).
68:19 | Then, a visitation from your Lord came down upon it while they slept,
68:20 | and in the morning it was if the garden had been reaped.
68:21 | (Then) in the morning they called out to one another, saying:
68:22 | 'Come out to your tillage if you want to reap'
68:23 | And so they departed, whispering to one another:
68:24 | 'No needy person shall set foot in it today'
68:25 | And they went out early, determined in their resolve.
68:26 | But when they saw it they said: 'We have surely gone astray.
68:27 | No, rather, we have been prevented'
68:28 | (Whereupon) the best among them said: 'Did I not say to you to exalt (Allah)'
68:29 | 'Exaltations to Allah, our Lord' they said, 'We were truly harmdoers'
68:30 | And they came blaming one another.
68:31 | They said 'Woe to us, truly we were insolent'
68:32 | It may be that our Lord will give us better than it in exchange. To our Lord we humbly turn'
68:33 | Such was their punishment. But the punishment of the Everlasting Life is much greater, if they but knew.
68:34 | Surely, the cautious shall have Gardens of Bliss with their Lord.
68:35 | What, shall We make those who are submissive like the wrongdoers?
68:36 | What is the matter with you then, how do you judge?
68:37 | Or, have you a Book from which you study
68:38 | surely in it you shall have whatever you choose!
68:39 | Or, have you an oath from Us that stretches to the Day of Resurrection (if so) you shall surely have what you judge!
68:40 | Ask them, which of them will guarantee that!
68:41 | Or, do they have associates? Then let them bring their associates, if what they say is true!
68:42 | On the Day when the leg shall be bared, and they are ordered to prostrate themselves, they will be unable.
68:43 | Their eyes will be humbled, and humiliation shall spread over them for they were already ordered to prostrate themselves when they were undiminished.
68:44 | Therefore, leave Me with he who belied this discourse. We will draw them on little by little from where they do not know.
68:45 | I shall respite them, My stratagem is firm.
68:46 | Or, do you ask them for a wage, so that they are burdened withdebt?
68:47 | Or, is the Unseen with them, and they are writing it down!
68:48 | So be patient with the judgement of your Lord and do not be like the Companion of the Whale (Jonah), when he called out choking inwardly.
68:49 | Had the favor of his Lord not come upon him, he would have been blamed, cast upon the shore.
68:50 | But his Lord had chosen him and He placed him among the righteous.
68:51 | When the unbelievers hear the Reminder, they nearly strike you down with their glances, and say: 'Surely, he is mad'
68:52 | But it is nothing other than a Reminder for all the worlds.
