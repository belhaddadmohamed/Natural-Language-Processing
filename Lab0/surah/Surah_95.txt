95:1 | By the fig and the olive!
95:2 | and the Mount, Sinai,
95:3 | and this safe country (Mecca)!
95:4 | Indeed, We created the human with the fairest stature
95:5 | and We shall return him to the lowest of the low,
95:6 | except the believers who do good works, for theirs shall be an unfailing recompense.
95:7 | So, what then shall belie you concerning the Recompense?
95:8 | Is Allah not the Most Just of judges!
