84:1 | When the sky is torn apart,
84:2 | hearing and obeying its Lord, as it must do;
84:3 | when the earth is stretched out
84:4 | and casts out all that is within and voids itself,
84:5 | obeying its Lord, as it must do!
84:6 | O human, you are working hard towards your Lord and you will meet Him.
84:7 | Then, he who is given his Book in his right hand
84:8 | shall have an easy reckoning
84:9 | and will return rejoicing to his family.
84:10 | But he who is given his Book from behind his back
84:11 | shall call for destruction
84:12 | and roast at the Blaze.
84:13 | Once, he lived joyfully among his family
84:14 | and surely thought he would never return (to his Lord).
84:15 | Yes indeed, his Lord was ever watching him.
84:16 | I swear by the twilight;
84:17 | by the night and all that it envelops;
84:18 | by the moon, in its fullness
84:19 | that you shall surely ride from stage to stage.
84:20 | What is the matter with them, that they do not believe
84:21 | and when the Koran is recited to them that they do not prostrate!
84:22 | No, the unbelievers only belie,
84:23 | and Allah knows very well what they gather.
84:24 | Therefore give to them glad tidings of a painful punishment,
84:25 | except to those who believe, and do righteous deeds, for theirs is an unfailing recompense.
