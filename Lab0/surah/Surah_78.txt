78:1 | What do they question each other about!
78:2 | About the Great News
78:3 | whereupon they are at variance?
78:4 | Indeed, they shall know!
78:5 | Again, indeed, they shall know!
78:6 | Have We not made the earth as a cradle
78:7 | and the mountains as pegs?
78:8 | And We created you in pairs,
78:9 | and We made your sleep a rest,
78:10 | and We made the night a mantle,
78:11 | and We made the day for a livelihood.
78:12 | And We built above you seven strong ones,
78:13 | and placed in them a blazing lamp
78:14 | and have sent down from the clouds, pouring rain
78:15 | that We may bring forth with it grain, plants
78:16 | and luxuriant gardens.
78:17 | Indeed, the Day of Decision is an appointed time,
78:18 | the Day that the Horn is blown, and you shall come in crowds
78:19 | and heaven is opened, having gates,
78:20 | and the mountains move, and vaporize.
78:21 | Indeed, Gehenna (Hell) has become an ambush,
78:22 | a return for the insolent,
78:23 | there, they shall live for ages,
78:24 | tasting neither coolness nor any drink
78:25 | except boiling water and pus
78:26 | for a suitable recompense.
78:27 | Indeed, they did not hope for a Reckoning,
78:28 | and they absolutely belied Our verses,
78:29 | and everything We have numbered in a Book.
78:30 | 'Taste! We shall not increase you except in punishment'
78:31 | But, for the cautious a place of prosperity,
78:32 | and gardens and vineyards,
78:33 | curvaceous (virgins), of equal age
78:34 | and an overflowing cup.
78:35 | There, they shall neither hear idle talk, nor yet any falsehood,
78:36 | a recompense from your Lord, a gift, a reckoning,
78:37 | the Lord of the heavens and earth, and all that is between them, the Merciful, of whom they are unable to speak.
78:38 | On that Day, when the Spirit (Gabriel) and the angels stand in ranks they shall not speak, except he to whom the Merciful has given permission, and sayswhat is right.
78:39 | That is the Day, the truth, so whosoever wills takes a way to his Lord.
78:40 | Indeed, We have forewarned you of an imminent punishment, the Day when the person will look upon his works and the unbelievers will say: 'Would that I were dust'
