51:1 | By the scatterers (the wind) scattering,
51:2 | then the bearers of weight (the clouds),
51:3 | then the easy runners (the ships);
51:4 | then by the distributors (angels), ordered;
51:5 | indeed, that which you are promised is true,
51:6 | and the recompense shall surely happen.
51:7 | By the heaven with its passages,
51:8 | surely, you are in different sayings,
51:9 | and are turned away from him who is turned.
51:10 | Woe to the liars
51:11 | who are heedless in the immersion.
51:12 | 'When will the Day of Judgement be' they ask.
51:13 | On that Day they shall be tried at the Fire,
51:14 | 'Taste your trial. This is what you have sought to hasten'
51:15 | The righteous shall live among gardens and fountains,
51:16 | receiving what their Lord will give them because before this they were gooddoers.
51:17 | They slept but a little at night,
51:18 | and at dawn would ask forgiveness,
51:19 | and in their wealth was a share for whosoever asked and for whosoever was prevented.
51:20 | For those with sure belief there are signs in the earth,
51:21 | and also in yourselves. Can you not see?
51:22 | In the sky is your provision and that which you are promised.
51:23 | So by the Lord of heaven and earth, it is as true as your speech.
51:24 | Have you heard the story of Abraham's honored guests?
51:25 | They entered to him and said: 'Peace' And he replied: 'Peace, you are people unknown to me'
51:26 | So he turned to his household and brought a fattened calf.
51:27 | He set it before them, saying: 'Will you not eat'
51:28 | Then he conceived a fear about them, and they said: 'Have no fear', and gave him the glad tidings that he was to have a knowledgeable son.
51:29 | (Sarah) his wife came with an exclamation and clasped her face, and said: 'Surely, I am a barren old woman'
51:30 | 'Such, says your Lord' they replied: 'He is the Wise, the Knower'
51:31 | 'Messengers' said he (Abraham), 'what is your errand'
51:32 | They replied: 'We are sent to a sinful nation,
51:33 | so that we bring down stones of clay upon them
51:34 | marked by your Lord for the sinful'
51:35 | So We brought the believers out of that they were in.
51:36 | But We found in it only one household of those who had surrendered themselves,
51:37 | and left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment.
51:38 | In Moses, too, (there were signs). We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority,
51:39 | but he turned his back with his Assembly, saying: 'He is (either) a sorcerer or a mad man'
51:40 | So We seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea. Indeed, he was blameworthy.
51:41 | And in Aad. We let loose on them a withering wind
51:42 | that left nothing it came upon, except that it was ashes.
51:43 | And in Thamood it was said to them: 'Take your enjoyment for awhile'
51:44 | But in their pride they turn away from the commandment of their Lord and the thunderbolt struck them whilst they were looking;
51:45 | they could neither stand up straight, nor were they helped.
51:46 | And before them the nation of Noah, indeed they were a debauched nation.
51:47 | We built the heaven with might, and We widely extended it.
51:48 | and We cradled the earth. And We are the Best of Cradlers.
51:49 | We created two kinds of all things, so that you will remember.
51:50 | Therefore, flee to Allah. I am a clear warner to you from Him.
51:51 | Do not set up with Allah another god. I am a clear warner to you from Him.
51:52 | Similarly, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: 'Sorcerer, or mad'
51:53 | Have they handed this down from one to another? No, rather, they are an insolent nation.
51:54 | So turn away from them, you shall not be blamed,
51:55 | But remind, the Reminder will benefit the believers.
51:56 | I have not created mankind and jinn except to worship Me.
51:57 | I do not desire provision from them, nor do I desire that they should feed Me.
51:58 | Surely, Allah is the Provider, the Possessor of Power, the Mighty.
51:59 | The evildoers shall have for their portion, a portion like their companions (who were destroyed before them). Therefore, they should not ask Us to hasten!
51:60 | Woe then to the unbelievers for their Day which they were promised!
