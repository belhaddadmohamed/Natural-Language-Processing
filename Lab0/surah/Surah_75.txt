75:1 | No! I swear by the Day of Resurrection,
75:2 | No! I swear by the reproachful soul!
75:3 | What, does the human think We shall never gather his bones?
75:4 | Indeed yes, We are able to shape his fingerstips yet again!
75:5 | Rather, the human desires to continue in his immorality,
75:6 | 'When will the Day of Resurrection be' he asks,
75:7 | but when the sight is dazed
75:8 | and the moon eclipsed,
75:9 | when the sun and moon are gathered together
75:10 | on that Day the human will ask: 'To (which place) shall I flee'
75:11 | No, there shall be no (place of) refuge.
75:12 | For on that Day the refuge shall be to your Lord.
75:13 | On that Day the human shall be informed of his former and latter deeds.
75:14 | He shall be a clear proof against himself,
75:15 | even though he offers his excuses.
75:16 | Do not move your tongue with it (the Revelation) to hasten it.
75:17 | It's gathering and reciting is upon Us.
75:18 | When We recite it, follow its recitation.
75:19 | It's explanation is upon Us.
75:20 | Yet you love this hasty world
75:21 | and are heedless of the Everlasting Life.
75:22 | On that Day there shall be radiant faces,
75:23 | gazing towards their Lord.
75:24 | And on that Day there shall be scowling faces,
75:25 | so they might think the Calamity had been inflicted upon them.
75:26 | But, when (the soul) reaches the collar bone
75:27 | and it is said: 'Who is a healing chanter'
75:28 | and when he thinks it is the time of departure
75:29 | and when leg is intertwined with leg,
75:30 | upon that Day the driving shall be to your Lord.
75:31 | Because, he neither believed nor prayed;
75:32 | he belied the truth and turned away;
75:33 | then went arrogantly to his household.
75:34 | Near to you and nearer,
75:35 | then nearer to you and nearer!
75:36 | Does the human think he will be left to roam at will?
75:37 | What, was he not an ejaculated drop (of sperm)?
75:38 | Then he was a clot of blood, then He created and formed him
75:39 | and made from him two kinds, male and female.
75:40 | What, is He then unable to revive the dead?
