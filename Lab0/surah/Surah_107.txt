107:1 | Have you seen he who belied the Recompense?
107:2 | It is he who turns away the orphan
107:3 | and does not urge others to feed the needy.
107:4 | Woe to those who pray,
107:5 | who are heedless of their prayers (delaying them from their prescribed times),
107:6 | who show off,
107:7 | and prevent the utensils of assistance.
