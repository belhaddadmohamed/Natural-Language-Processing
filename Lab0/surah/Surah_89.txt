89:1 | By the dawn
89:2 | and ten nights (of pilgrimage or the last ten days of Ramadan),
89:3 | by the even, and the odd,
89:4 | by the night when it journeys on!
89:5 | Is there in that an oath for the mindful?
89:6 | Have you not heard how your Lord dealt with Aad?
89:7 | of the columned (city) of Iram,
89:8 | the like of which was never created in the countries?
89:9 | And Thamood, who hewed out the rocks of the valley?
89:10 | And Pharaoh, of the pegs (impaling his victims)?
89:11 | They were tyrants in the land
89:12 | and exceeded in corruption therein.
89:13 | (Therefore) your Lord let loose upon them a scourge of punishment;
89:14 | indeed, your Lord is ever watchful.
89:15 | As for man, when his Lord tests him by honoring him and favoring him, he says: 'My Lord, has honored me'
89:16 | But when He tests him by restricting his provision, he says: 'My Lord has humiliated me'
89:17 | No! But you show no good to the orphan,
89:18 | nor do you urge one another to feed the needy.
89:19 | and you devour the inheritance with greed,
89:20 | and you ardently love wealth.
89:21 | No! But when the earth quakes and is pounded,
89:22 | and your Lord comes with the angels, rank upon rank,
89:23 | and Gehenna (Hell) is brought near on that Day the human will remember, and how shall the Reminder be for him?
89:24 | He will say: 'Would that I had forwarded (good works) for my life!'
89:25 | But on that Day none will punish as He (Allah) will punish,
89:26 | nor will any bind as He binds.
89:27 | O satisfied soul,
89:28 | return to your Lord wellpleased, wellpleasing.
89:29 | Join My worshipers and
89:30 | enter My Paradise!
