94:1 | Have We not expanded your chest for you (Prophet Muhammad),
94:2 | and relieved you of your burden
94:3 | that weighed down your back?
94:4 | Have We not raised your remembrance?
94:5 | Indeed, hardship is followed by ease,
94:6 | indeed, hardship is followed by ease!
94:7 | So, when you have finished (your prayer), labor (in supplication),
94:8 | and let your longing be for your Lord (in humility).
