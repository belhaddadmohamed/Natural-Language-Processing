97:1 | We sent this (the Holy Koran) down on the Night of Honor.
97:2 | What could let you know what the Night of Honor is!
97:3 | The Night of Honor is better than a thousand months,
97:4 | in it the angels and the Spirit (Gabriel) descend by the permission of their Lord upon every command.
97:5 | Peace it is, till the break of dawn.
