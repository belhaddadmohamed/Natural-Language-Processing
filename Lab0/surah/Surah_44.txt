44:1 | HaMeem
44:2 | By the Clear Book
44:3 | that We sent down during a Blessed Night. We are ever warning.
44:4 | In it every wise matter is determined
44:5 | an order from Us. We are ever sending.
44:6 | A Mercy from your Lord, He is the Hearer, the Knower.
44:7 | Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if you are certain (of your faith).
44:8 | There is no god except He. He revives and causes to die. (He is) your Lord and the Lord of your fathers, the ancients.
44:9 | Yet they are in doubt, playing.
44:10 | Watch for the Day when the heaven will bring clear smoke,
44:11 | engulfing the people; this will be a painful punishment.
44:12 | 'Our Lord, remove this punishment from us, we are believers'
44:13 | But how will they avail themselves of the Reminder, when a clear Messenger had already come to them
44:14 | but then they turned away from him, saying: 'He is tutored, mad'
44:15 | We are removing the punishment a little, but you revert.
44:16 | But on that Day We will assault them most mightily, and then We shall revenge!
44:17 | We tried Pharaoh's nation before them. A noble Messenger came to them,
44:18 | (saying:) 'Be obedient to me O worshipers of Allah. I am your honest Messenger.
44:19 | Do not rise up against Allah, I come to you with clear authority.
44:20 | I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord lest you stone me.
44:21 | And if you do not believe me, then leave me'
44:22 | Then he supplicated to his Lord saying: 'These are sinful people'
44:23 | (His Lord answered): 'Set out with My worshipers in the night, for you will surely be followed.
44:24 | Then leave the sea calm they are an army that will be drowned.
44:25 | How many gardens and fountains did they leave behind,
44:26 | and sown fields, fine sitting places,
44:27 | and good things in which they took delight.
44:28 | As such (it was). And We made other people inherit them.
44:29 | Neither heaven nor earth shed tears for them; nor were they respited,
44:30 | and We saved the Children of Israel from a humiliating punishment
44:31 | from Pharaoh, who ranked high in sin,
44:32 | and We chose them, out of a knowledge above the nations (of their time).
44:33 | And gave signs to them in which there was a clear trial.
44:34 | Yet these say:
44:35 | 'There is nothing except the first death, we shall never be revived.
44:36 | Bring us our fathers, if what you say is true'
44:37 | Are they better or the people of Tubba' and those who were before them whom We destroyed? Indeed they were sinners.
44:38 | It was not in play that We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them.
44:39 | We created them in nothing else except the truth. But most do not know.
44:40 | The Day of Decision is the appointed time for all.
44:41 | On that Day no cousin shall help his cousin and they shall not be helped
44:42 | except those on whom Allah will have mercy. He is the Almighty, the Most Merciful.
44:43 | The food of the Zakkum tree
44:44 | shall be the food of the guilty sinners.
44:45 | Like molten copper boiling in the belly
44:46 | as the boiling of the hot water.
44:47 | 'Seize him and drag him into the center of Hell.
44:48 | Then pour the punishment of boiling water over his head,
44:49 | (Saying): 'Taste, surely you are the mighty and noble!
44:50 | This is that which you doubted'
44:51 | Indeed, for those who feared (Allah) is a secure place
44:52 | amidst gardens and fountains,
44:53 | dressed in silks and brocade, set face to face.
44:54 | As such, We shall wed them to wideeyed houris (the virgins of Paradise).
44:55 | There in security, they will call for every kind of fruit.
44:56 | There they shall not taste death, except the first death, and He will shield them from the punishment of Hell,
44:57 | as a bounty from your Lord. That will be the mighty triumph.
44:58 | We have now made it easy on your tongue, in order that they remember.
44:59 | So be watchful, they too are watching.
