96:1 | Read (Prophet Muhammad) in the Name of your Lord who created,
96:2 | created the human from a (blood) clot.
96:3 | Read! Your Lord is the Most Generous,
96:4 | who taught by the pen,
96:5 | taught the human what he did not know.
96:6 | Indeed, surely the human is very insolent
96:7 | that he sees himself sufficed.
96:8 | Indeed, to your Lord is the returning.
96:9 | What do you think? Have you seen he who forbids
96:10 | a worshiper when he prays.
96:11 | Have you seen if he was upon guidance
96:12 | or orders piety?
96:13 | What do you think? Have you seen if he belies and turns away,
96:14 | does he not know that Allah sees?
96:15 | Indeed, if he does not desist, We will seize him by the forelock,
96:16 | a lying, sinful forelock.
96:17 | So, let him call upon his way!
96:18 | We, will call the Zabania (the harsh angels of Hell).
96:19 | No, indeed; do not obey him! Prostrate and come nearer (to Allah).
