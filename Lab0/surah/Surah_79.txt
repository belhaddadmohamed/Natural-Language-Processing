79:1 | By the pluckers (the angels of death), violently plucking (the souls of the unbelievers),
79:2 | by the drawers (the angels of death), gently drawing (the souls of the believers),
79:3 | by the swimmers (angels) swimming gently
79:4 | and the outstrippers (angels), outstripping,
79:5 | by the managers (angels) affair.
79:6 | On the Day, the shiverer shivers
79:7 | followed by the succeeding,
79:8 | hearts will throb on that Day
79:9 | and their eyes will be humbled.
79:10 | They say: 'What, are we being restored as we were before,
79:11 | even after we are fragmented bones'
79:12 | They will say: 'Then we are returned lost'
79:13 | But it will be only a single blow,
79:14 | and they will be upon the surface of the earth (alive).
79:15 | Have you received the story of Moses?
79:16 | His Lord called to him in the Sacred Valley of Towa,
79:17 | saying 'Go to Pharaoh, he has become exceedingly insolent,
79:20 | He showed him the mighty sign,
79:21 | but he belied and disobeyed,
79:22 | and hastily turned away,
79:23 | then, he gathered, proclaimed, then said:
79:24 | 'I am your lord, the most high'
79:25 | So Allah seized him with the punishment of the Everlasting Life, and of this world.
79:26 | Surely, in this there is a lesson for he that fears!
79:27 | What, are you harder to create than the heaven which He has built?
79:28 | He raised it high and leveled it,
79:29 | and darkened its night and brought forth its morning.
79:30 | And the earth He extended after that;
79:31 | and then brought from it its water and pastures.
79:32 | And the mountains He set firm
79:33 | an enjoyment for you and your herds.
79:34 | But when the Great Catastrophe comes,
79:35 | the Day when the human will remember what he has worked for,
79:36 | and when Hell is advanced for whoever sees,
79:37 | then as for whosoever was insolent
79:38 | preferring the present life,
79:39 | surely, Hell will be their refuge.
79:40 | But, whosoever feared the standing before his Lord and prevented the self from desires,
79:41 | indeed, their refuge shall be Paradise.
79:42 | They will question you about the Hour: 'When shall it be'
79:43 | But how are you to know?
79:44 | Its final end is for your Lord.
79:45 | You are but a warner for those who fear it.
79:46 | On the Day when they behold it, it will be as if they had lingered but an evening, or, a morning.
