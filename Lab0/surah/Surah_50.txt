50:1 | Qaaf. By the Glorious Koran!
50:2 | No, but they marvel that from among themselves a warner has come to them. The unbelievers say (in mockery): 'This is a marvelous thing!
50:3 | What, when we are dead and turned to dust? That indeed would be an unlikely return'
50:4 | We know all that the earth takes away of them, and a Book of Records is with Us.
50:5 | Rather, they belied the truth when it came to them, and now they are in a state of confusion.
50:6 | What, have they never observed the heaven above them, (and seen) how We built and adorned it, leaving no crack?
50:7 | We spread out the earth and set upon it firm mountains, and We cause every delightful thing to grow in it
50:8 | as a lesson and a reminder to every penitent worshiper.
50:9 | We sent down blessed water from the sky with which We caused gardens and the grains of harvest to grow,
50:10 | and tall palmtrees with compact spathes
50:11 | as a provision for the worshipers; thereby We revived a land that was dead. Such shall be the emerging.
50:12 | Before them, the nation of Noah, the nation of ArRass belied and so did Thamood
50:13 | and Aad, Pharaoh and the brothers of Lot,
50:14 | the dwellers of the Thicket and the nation of Tubba', all belied their Messengers, therefore My threat was realized.
50:15 | What, were We wearied by the first creation? No, indeed; yet they are in doubt about a new creation.
50:16 | Indeed, We created the human. We know the whisperings of his soul, and are closer to him than the jugular vein.
50:17 | When both receivers (the angels) receive, one on his right, the other on his left,
50:18 | whatever phrase he utters, an observer is present.
50:19 | And when the agony of death comes in truth (they will say): 'This is what you have been trying to avoid'
50:20 | And the Horn shall be blown; that is the Day of Threat!
50:21 | Each soul shall come with a driver, and a witness.
50:22 | (It will be said): 'Of this you have been heedless. Therefore, we have now removed your covering. Today your sight is sharp'
50:23 | And his companion will say: 'This is that which I have present'
50:24 | (It will be said): 'Indeed, cast into Gehenna (Hell) every deviating unbeliever,
50:25 | forbidder of good, transgressor and doubter,
50:26 | who has set up with Allah another god. Indeed, you two, cast him into the terrible punishment'
50:27 | And his companion shall say: 'Our Lord, I did not make him insolent, he was far astray'
50:28 | He (Allah) will say: 'Do not dispute before Me. I sent you a warning beforehand.
50:29 | The Word cannot be changed with Me; I do not wrong My worshipers'
50:30 | On that Day We shall ask Gehenna: 'Are you full' And it will answer: 'Are there any more'
50:31 | And Paradise, which is not far away, shall be brought closer to those who were cautious.
50:32 | (It shall be said to them): 'This is that you were promised. It is for every heeding penitent.
50:33 | Whosoever fears the Merciful in the Unseen, and comes with a contrite heart.
50:34 | Enter it in peace. This is the Day of Eternity'
50:35 | There they have all that they desire, and with Us is much more.
50:36 | How many generations, stronger in might than they have We destroyed before them! They searched the land, could they find any asylum?
50:37 | Surely, in this there is a Reminder for he who has a heart or listens attentively while witnessing.
50:38 | In six days We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them and no weariness touched Us!
50:39 | Bear then with patience what they say. Exalt with the praise of your Lord before sunrise and before sunset.
50:40 | And exalt Him in the night, and at the ends of the prostrations.
50:41 | Listen for the Day when the Caller will call from a nearby place.
50:42 | On the Day when they will hear the Shout, in truth that Day they will emerge.
50:43 | It is We who give life and make to die. To Us is the arrival.
50:44 | Upon that Day the earth will be rent asunder from around them as they hurry forth that is an easy gathering for Us.
50:45 | Indeed, We know what they say. You (Prophet Muhammad) are not a tyrant over them. Therefore, remind by the Koran whosoever fears (My) threat.
