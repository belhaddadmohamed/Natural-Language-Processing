83:1 | Woe to the diminishers,
83:2 | who, when people measure for them, take full measure,
83:3 | but when they measure or weigh for others, they reduce!
83:4 | Do they not think that they will be resurrected
83:5 | for a great Day,
83:6 | the Day when people will stand before the Lord of the Worlds?
83:7 | No indeed, the Book of the immoral is in Sijjeen.
83:8 | What could let you know what the Sijjeen is!
83:9 | (It is) a marked Book.
83:10 | Woe on that Day to those who belied it,
83:11 | who belied the Day of Recompense!
83:12 | None belies it except every guilty sinner.
83:13 | When Our verses are recited to him, he says: 'Fictitious tales of the ancients'
83:14 | No indeed! Their own deeds have cast a veil over their hearts.
83:15 | No indeed, on that Day they shall be veiled from their Lord.
83:16 | Then they shall roast in Hell,
83:17 | and it will be said to them: 'This is that which you belied'
83:18 | But, the Book of the righteous is in the 'Illiyoon.
83:19 | What could let you know what the 'Illiyoon is!
83:20 | (It is) a marked Book,
83:21 | witnessed by those who are near (to Allah).
83:22 | The righteous shall indeed be blissful,
83:23 | (reclining) upon couches they will gaze,
83:24 | and in their faces you shall know the radiance of bliss.
83:25 | They shall be given to drink of a wine that is sealed,
83:26 | its seal is musk, for this let the competitors compete;
83:27 | and its mixture is Tasneem,
83:28 | a fountain at which those brought near (to their Lord) drink.
83:29 | The sinners laughed at the believers
83:30 | and winked at one another as they passed them by.
83:31 | When they returned to their people they returned jesting;
83:32 | and when they saw them said: 'These are they who are astray'
83:33 | Yet they were not sent to be their guardians.
83:34 | But on this Day the believers will laugh at the unbelievers
83:35 | as they (recline) upon their couches and gaze (around them).
83:36 | Have the unbelievers been rewarded for what they did?
