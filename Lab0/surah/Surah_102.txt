102:1 | The excessive gathering (of increase and boasting) occupied you (from worshipping and obeying)
102:2 | until you visit the graves.
102:3 | But no, indeed, you shall soon know.
102:4 | Again, no indeed, you shall soon know.
102:5 | Indeed, did you know with certain knowledge
102:6 | that you shall surely see Hell?
102:7 | Again, you shall surely see it with the sight of certainty.
102:8 | On that Day, you shall be questioned about the pleasures.
