91:1 | By the sun and its midmorning,
91:2 | by the moon, which follows it,
91:3 | by the day, when it displays it,
91:4 | by the night, when it envelops it!
91:5 | By the heaven and Who built it,
91:6 | by the earth and Who spread it,
91:7 | by the soul and Who shaped it
91:8 | and inspired it with its sin and its piety,
91:9 | prosperous is he who purified it,
91:10 | and failed is he who buried it!
91:11 | Thamood belied in their pride
91:12 | when the most wicked of them broke forth,
91:13 | the Messenger of Allah said to them: '(This is) the shecamel of Allah, let her drink'
91:14 | But they belied him, and hamstrung her. So their Lord crushed them for their sin and leveled it (their village).
91:15 | He does not fear the result (of their destruction).
