15:1 | AlifLaamRa. Those are the verses of the Book, the Clear Koran.
15:2 | It could be that those who disbelieve will wish that they were Muslims.
15:3 | Let them eat and enjoy; and let their hopes deceive them, soon they shall know.
15:4 | We never destroyed a village whose term had not already been decreed.
15:5 | No nation can outstrip its term, nor do they put it back.
15:6 | They say: 'You to whom the Remembrance is sent down, you are indeed mad.
15:7 | Why do you not bring down the angels, if what you say is true'
15:8 | We do not send angels except with the truth. Then they shall have no respite.
15:9 | It is We who sent down the Koran, and We watch over it.
15:10 | We have sent forth before you Messengers among the factions of the ancients.
15:11 | But no Messenger came to them except he was mocked.
15:12 | So We make it enter the hearts of the sinners.
15:13 | They do not believe in it even though the practice of the ancients has already gone.
15:14 | If We opened a gate in the heaven and they kept ascending through it,
15:15 | still they would say: 'Our eyes were dazzled; truly, we must have been a bewitched people'
15:16 | We have set constellations in the heavens and made them pleasing to the beholders,
15:17 | and guarded them from every stoned satan.
15:18 | Except for he who steals the listening and is then pursued by a visible flame.
15:19 | We have spread out the earth and set upon it firm mountains. Everything We have caused to grow therein is justly weighed;
15:20 | and there appointed for you is a livelihood, and for those you do not provide.
15:21 | And there is not a thing but with Us are its treasuries, and We do not send it down except in a known measure.
15:22 | We send the winds fertilizing, and We send down out of heaven water, from which you drink and you are not its treasurers.
15:23 | And surely, it is We who give life and make to die. We are the Inheritor.
15:24 | We know those of you who press forward, and We know the laggards,
15:25 | and it is your Lord who will gather them. He is Wise, Knowing.
15:26 | We created mankind from clay, molded from mud,
15:27 | and before him We created the jinn from smokeless fire.
15:28 | When your Lord said to the angels: 'See, I am creating a mortal from clay of molded mud.
15:29 | When I have shaped him and ran My created soul in him fall down prostrating towards him'.
15:30 | All the angels prostrated themselves,
15:31 | except iblis (father of the jinn) who refused to be one of those who prostrated themselves.
15:32 | He said: 'iblis, what is the matter with you, that you do you not prostrate yourself'
15:33 | He replied: 'I will not prostrate to a mortal You have created of clay, from molded mud'
15:34 | (Allah) said: 'Begone, you are accursed!
15:35 | A curse shall be on you till the Day of Recompense'
15:36 | He said: 'My Lord, reprieve me till the Day they are raised'
15:37 | He answered: 'You are among those reprieved
15:38 | till the appointed time.
15:39 | (satan) said: 'My Lord, for Your perverting me, I shall make (matters) in the earth seem most fair to them and I shall pervert all,
15:40 | except the devoted amongst Your worshippers.
15:41 | He (Allah) said: 'This is for Me the Right Path
15:42 | over My worshipers you have no authority, except the perverse that follow you.
15:43 | Gehenna (Hell) will be the promise for all of them.
15:44 | It has seven gates, and through each gate a portion of them belong.
15:45 | But the cautious shall live amongst gardens and fountains:
15:46 | 'In peace and security, enter them'
15:47 | We shall remove all rancor from their hearts, and as brethren they shall recline on couches face to face.
15:48 | There, no fatigue shall smite them, nor shall they ever be driven from it'
15:49 | Tell My worshipers that I am the Forgiving, the Most Merciful,
15:50 | and that My punishment is the painful chastisement.
15:51 | Tell them of Abraham's guests.
15:52 | They entered to him and said: 'Peace' but he replied: 'We are afraid of you'
15:53 | 'Do not be afraid' they answered. 'We come to give you glad tidings of a knowledgeable child'
15:54 | He said: 'What is this, do you bring me glad tidings even though I am old' Of what do you give me glad tidings'
15:55 | They replied: 'In truth we have given you glad tidings, do not be one of those who despair'
15:56 | He replied: 'And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord, except those that are astray?
15:57 | He asked: 'Messengers, what is your errand'
15:58 | They replied: 'We are sent to sinful nation.
15:59 | Except Lot's family, of whom we shall save all,
15:60 | but his wife. We decreed that she should be amongst those who remain behind.
15:61 | And when the envoys came to the family of Lot,
15:62 | he said to them: 'I do not know you'
15:63 | 'No' they replied: 'We bring you (news) of that concerning which they were doubting.
15:64 | We bring you the truth, and indeed we are truthful.
15:65 | Depart with your family in a part of the night and walk behind them and let none of you turn round. Go to a place where you are commanded'
15:66 | And We made known to him this decree that the wrongdoers were to be utterly cut off in the morning.
15:67 | The people of the city came to him rejoicing.
15:68 | He said: 'These are my guests; do not shame me.
15:69 | Fear Allah and do not disgrace me'
15:70 | They replied: 'Have we not forbidden you (the people of) the worlds'
15:71 | He said: 'Here are my daughters; take them (in marriage), if you would be doing'
15:72 | By your life, they wandered blindly in their dazzlement.
15:73 | At sunrise a dreadful Shout seized them.
15:74 | We laid it (the city) upside down and rained stones of baked clay upon them.
15:75 | Surely, in that there are signs for those who contemplate.
15:76 | Indeed, it is on a way which still exists.
15:77 | Surely, in that there is a sign for those who believe.
15:78 | The dwellers of the Thicket were harmdoers.
15:79 | On them, too, We took vengeance, and they are both on a clear roadway.
15:80 | And the dwellers of Al Hijr also belied the Messengers.
15:81 | We brought them signs, but they turned away.
15:82 | They hewed their dwellings out of the mountains in safety.
15:83 | But the Shout seized them in the morning,
15:84 | and that which they had earned did not help them.
15:85 | We did not create the heavens and the earth, and what is between them except in truth. The Hour is sure to come, therefore, forgive them with a graciouspardon.
15:86 | Your Lord is the Creator, the Knower.
15:87 | We have given you the seven dual (verses, Al Fatihah) and the Mighty Holy Reading (Koran).
15:88 | Do not stretch your eyes to that We have given pairs of them to enjoy, nor sorrow for them, and lower your wing to the believers.
15:89 | And say: 'I am the plain warner'
15:90 | So We sent it down to the partitioners,
15:91 | who have broken the Koran into parts,
15:92 | so by your Lord, We will question them all
15:93 | about what they did.
15:94 | Proclaim then, what you are commanded and turn away from the unbelievers.
15:95 | We suffice you against those who mock,
15:96 | and those who set up other gods with Allah, indeed, they will soon know.
15:97 | Indeed, We know your chest is straitened by that they say.
15:98 | Exalt with the praise of your Lord and be one of those who prostrate.
15:99 | Worship your Lord till the certainty (death) comes to you.
