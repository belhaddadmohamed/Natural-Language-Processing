54:1 | The Hour is drawing near, and the moon is split (in two).
54:2 | Yet if they see a sign (the unbelievers) turn their backs and say: 'This is but a continuation of sorcery'
54:3 | They have belied, and follow their own fancies. But, every issue will be settled!
54:4 | Tidings containing a deterrent have come to them
54:5 | which are full of wisdom; but the warnings do not help.
54:6 | Therefore, turn away from them. On the Day when the Caller summons them to a terrible thing,
54:7 | their eyes will be humbled as they come out from their graves as if they were scattered locusts,
54:8 | running (with their necks extended) to the Caller. The unbelievers will say: 'This is indeed a harsh Day'
54:9 | (Long) before them the nation of Noah belied. They belied Our worshiper saying: 'Mad' and he was reprimanded.
54:10 | Then he supplicated to his Lord, (saying): 'I am overcome, help me'
54:11 | We opened the Gates of Heaven with torrential water
54:12 | and caused the earth to gush with springs, so that the waters met for a predestined matter.
54:13 | We carried him in a well built, watertight vessel made from planks (of wood)
54:14 | that ran on under Our Eyes, a recompense for him because he had been disbelieved.
54:15 | We have left it as a sign. Is there any that will remember?
54:16 | How then were My punishment and My warnings!
54:17 | We have made the Koran easy to remember, is there any that will remember!
54:18 | Aad too belied. How then were My punishment and My warnings!
54:19 | And We sent against them a howling wind in a Day of continuous of ill fortune
54:20 | and snatched people up as though they were stumps of uprooted palmtrees.
54:21 | How then were My punishment and My warnings!
54:22 | We have made the Koran easy to remember, is there any that will remember?
54:23 | Thamood, too, belied Our warnings.
54:24 | They said: 'Are we to follow a mortal who is one of us? Then indeed, we would surely be in error and insane.
54:25 | Out of all of us has the Reminder been given to him alone? Rather, he is indeed an arrogant liar'
54:26 | (To him We said): 'Tomorrow they shall know who is the arrogant liar.
54:27 | We are sending to them as a trial, a shecamel, so watch them and have patience.
54:28 | Tell them that the water is to be divided between them, a drink each for them in turn'
54:29 | But they called their companion who took hold of her and hamstrung her.
54:30 | How then were My punishment and My warnings!
54:31 | Then We sent against them one Shout and they became like the trampled twigs of the (sheep) penbuilder.
54:32 | We have made the Koran an easy Remembrance, is there any that will remember!
54:33 | The nation of Lot belied Our warnings.
54:34 | We let loose on all of them a squall of claystones, except for the house of Lot whom We saved at dawn
54:35 | through Our Mercy. So it is that We recompense the thankful.
54:36 | He had warned them of Our assault but they disputed the warnings.
54:37 | They even solicited of him his guests, but We obliterated their eyes: 'Now, taste My punishment and My warnings'
54:38 | And at daybreak a determined punishment came upon them.
54:39 | 'Now, taste My punishment and My warnings'
54:40 | We have made the Koran an easy Remembrance, is there any that will remember!
54:41 | The warnings also came to Pharaoh's people,
54:42 | but they belied all Our signs so We seized them with the seizing of the Mighty, Powerful.
54:43 | What then, are your unbelievers better than those? Or do you have an immunity (written) in the Scrolls?
54:44 | Or do they say: 'We are a gathering that will be victorious'
54:45 | Most certainly their gatherings shall be routed, and they will turn their backs.
54:46 | Rather, the Hour is their encounter. And that Hour will be most calamitous and bitter.
54:47 | Indeed the wrongdoers are in error and a raging fire.
54:48 | On the Day when they are dragged on their faces into the Fire, (it will be said to them): 'Taste the touch of the Scorching'
54:49 | Indeed, We have created all things according to a measure.
54:50 | And Our Order is but one word like the flashing of an eye.
54:51 | And We destroyed those like you, is there any that will remember!
54:52 | All their deeds are in the Scrolls,
54:53 | everything, be it great or small, is recorded.
54:54 | Indeed, the cautious shall live amid gardens and a river,
54:55 | in a secure abode, in the presence of the Powerful King.
